## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/)

- [`Make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (required for bundling & compiling, command `npm run build-only` does not depend on it)

- [`QuickJS`](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) (optional, but required for compiling into an executable)

    QuickJS is a lightweight JavaScript interpreter written in C, designed for minimal size and fast startup. You can find it in [Fabrice Bellard's repo](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs).

    Binary builds can be found at the [release page](https://bellard.org/quickjs/binary_releases/).

> [!TIP]
  Cosmopolitan binaries are recommended. (`quickjs-cosmo-YYYY-MM-DD.zip`).
  This type of build can run on `Linux`, `Mac`, `Windows`, `FreeBSD`, `OpenBSD` and `NetBSD` for both `ARM64` and `x86_64` architectures.

> [!WARNING]
   `qjsc` is not available in the cosmopolitan release, but is available in other releases with OS and architecture specifications. For `ARM64` users, the binary builds can be obtained from the [quickjs-build repo](https://github.com/napi-bindings/quickjs-build/releases).

### Steps

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Build the project:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    make build
    ```

    To create a single executable file, use:

    ```bash
    npm run compile
    # or
    make compile
    ```

    If you wish to build the TypeScript files only, you can use:

    ```bash
    npm run build-only
    ```

3. The bundled JavaScript file (or executable) can be found in the `dist/` folder. It should be run in the QuickJS environment.

Options:

| Options | Description |

| `-a, --assemble <file>` | To assemble the given file into the binary version |
| `-r, --run <file>` | To run the given binary file |

| `-b, --bits <number>` | To specify the number of bits to use for VM |
| `-v, --verbose` | To enable verbose mode |

## Machine Instruction Set Documentation

### Number Representation

- Binary number: `B<binary number>`

    e.g. `B00000011` represents a 8-bit binary number `3`.

- Decimal number: `#<decimal number>`

    e.g. `#42` represents the number `42`.

- Hexadecimal number: `&<hexadecimal number>`

    e.g. `&2A` represents the number `42`.

### Register Representation

Register: `<code>`

| Register    | Code  |
|-------------|-------|
| Accumulator | `ACC` |
| Current instruction register | `CIR` |
| Index register | `IX` |
| Memory address register | `MAR` |
| Memory data register | `MDR` |
| Program counter | `PC` |

**Register codes are case-sensitive and reserved.**

### Comparisons

Comparisons are performed using comparison commands (`CMP`, `CMI`). 

A comparison is deemed successful if all three conditions are met: 

- the carry flag is not set
- the negative flag is not set
- the zero flag is set (indicating the two values are equal).

### Label Representation

Labels: `<label>:`

e.g. `loop:`

**Labels are case-sensitive.**

### Mnemonics

**Mnemonics are case-sensitive.**
